**Lab 4**

Correctly implemented works:
* Colors
* Unordered lists
* Hyperlink buttons with decorations
* Misc. styling
* All files passed validators; exceptions noted below.

I attempted to do the following but failed to do so:
* Colored borders for buttons [like so](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp)

People I have worked with on this project:
* My brother. Helped solve the problem of why I was receiving "repo not found" errors. Also gave me "vacuum cleaning" as a "major".

Other notes:
* According to [this](https://www.quackit.com/css/css3/properties/css_appearance.cfm) page, "button" is a valid value for "appearance", depsite what the CSS validator says.
* According to [this](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_nested), "ul" is allowed for nested lists, despite what the HTML validator says.
* Approx. 5 to 6 hours spent on this lab.
