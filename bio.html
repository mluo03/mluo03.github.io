		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p class = "textblock">
			I spent the first half of my life in different places around New England, spending much of those years in Connecticut. In 2009, my family moved to Hong Kong where I would spend the rest of my grade school career.
			I applied EDII to Tufts, and started school here upon graduating high school in 2015.
